# Final-Project

## Synopsis

This project is a fun text baised adventure.

## Code Example

An example of what you are going to be doing would be a quote from the adventure. I chose this because it is a perfect example of how I wrote the story. 
```
You pull out the ancient book of scripture, found in the deepest Hebrew cave. You flip through the pages then read the sacred phrase, No U." I chose this because it is a perfect example of how I wrote the story.

```

## How to Play

All you need to do is type in your choice when prompted. For example, type attack if you want to attack and type defend when you want to defend.
