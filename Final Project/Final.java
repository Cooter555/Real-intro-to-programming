As the glass settles around you, a feeling of disturing familiarity surrouds you, like you've been her before.  In the distance you hear a food review being filmed, and peeking out of the shadows, a figure of a man - no, a God - with spikes surrounding his head like a halo.  You decide to try some of the food. In the rubble you find a dish undisturbed. You pick up a rib covered in BBQ sauce. You take a bite and sure enough it is full of flavor. One could even say it took you to FlavorTown®. Fear overcomes you as you realize what you have just done. This isn't a diner, its a combination of a diner, a drive in, and a dive. You turn around and are face to face with the legend, Guy Ferrari. Do you choose to attack or defend?";

Guy then waves his hand and incapacites you with a spell of his own. As you stand there helpless, Guy approaches. He wips out a Colt 45. He takes a bullet and smothers it in his signature BBQ sauce. He loads the bullet and sticks the gun in your mouth.  With tear in your eyes, you know its over. He stares into your soul the same way he would stare at an overcooked steak and utters one final sentance. Flavortown will welcome me with raised arms, can you say the same? You have died.";

Quickly, you capture him in a cage that is dangling from the celing. You reach for the sky chanting, KALI MAAAA! KALI MAAAA! He screams but no one can hear him. You reach for his chest, the screams echoing in your soul. You burrow through his rib cage, grab his heart, and rip it out. While you hold his still beating heart, you open the celar. Inside is enough flaming hot bbq sauce to last a lifetime. You then open every single bottle and pour it on the floor. By the end the heat is so intense that stone surrounding it begins to melt. You lower his still twitching body into the celar. As he reaches the bottom the heart in your hand bursts into flames, just like the body it came from. Its over, guy is no more.

Its not just the smell that is odd, you are standing in knee deep marsh. You wade to dry land. As you reach land you smell the smell again, but this time its stronger. It is the smell of onions. You begin to walk around. The smell of onions becoming ever stronger. Then you see it. A giant tree that is so big that someone made a house out of it. The smell is so bad it is bringing tears to your eyes. You walk to the door of the house. As you are about to enter you hear a voice behind you. What are you doing in my swamp, says the voice. You turn around and are face to face with none other than Shrek! Do you choose to attack or defend?";

When the dust settles you find yourself in a crater with Shrek. Now is the time to strike! Shrek is very good at close quarters combat, you decide to use more ranged weapons. You whip out the most powerful ranged weapons you have. Yeet, Yoink, and Big Mood. You launch a Yeet follwed by a Yoink and then a Big Mood. Each one hitting him causing an explosion subsequently followed by a large shockwave. You continue doing this, rattling off shot after shot. You keep doing this until long after you know he is dead. When you finaly stop you take a breath of fresh air, wating for the light to come again. But when you look at the massive hole in the ground, there is absolutly no sign of Shrek. You know its over now, you can feel him standing behind you now. He whispers in your ear, Shrek is Love, Shrek is Life. Wait wrong fanfic! He actually said, Nobody messes with my swamp. Shrek then did what all Ogers do, he brutally ripped your head off. You have died.";

WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY SWAMP!! You panic trying to figure out what to do. Shrek walks closter, anger consuming him. You've got it! You need to summon a being that will not only counter his massive anger, but also beat the devil out of him. You begin to whistle and sing in a high pitched voice, like Snow White you call upon small woodland creatures. Lots of small creatures begin to attack Shrek. The animals do no damage to him, they only annoy him. Because of their small size and quick movement they can dodge all of his attacks. But wait! Shrek managed to land a blow on a small squirrel. He is so small that he could fit into your pocket, and when you gaze upon him you are reminded of a pea pod. Oh no! Shrek has injured Peapod the Pocket Squirrel! Before you know it, reality itself tears apart. When the massive tear dissapears none other than Bob Ross is standing there! Shrek is frozen; he is overcome with fear! Bob Ross walks over and picks up Peapod. He smiles and says, There are no mistakes, just happy accidents. But for this mistake, well, let's get crazy. Shrek screams, but it is too late. A beam of pure happiness erupts from Bob Ross. Shrek just got the devil beat out of him. Shrek then walks home, an oger with no anger left.

You decide to summon power of both God and Anime to help defeat the beast.  As you rage with power from the likes of Goku and Naruto, Greg’s expressionless face creeps into a smile.  You decide to end the fight fast. You gather all of your power into one, single punch. In a brilliant show of light you wind up and punch at Greg. An explosion that would rival a nuclear bomb ensues. As the dust settles you take a deep breath, it's over. As you stand up and are about to leave, you hear something. You hear a friendly hello right behind you. Your stomach sinks. You turn around and are terrified by what you see. Greg is looming behind you, not a scratch on his body. Greg laughs maniacally: you know it’s over for you, for he is using merely 5% of his power. As he laughed his eyes shine a brilliant red . He raises his hand preparing to kill. In your moment of desperation you are saved! Your savior is none other than the mythical Rockey, late as always! You smile because you know she is the only being capable of matching Greg. She is the light to his dark, the yin to his yang. You run away, leaving the two absolutes to fight an endless battle.";

You watch as Greg steps back, fear overcomes you. He laughs and says, Puny child, I won't even need to use 5% of my power. You scream but no one can hear you. You try to run but you cannot get through your no u shield. Greg maniacally laughs as he lets out a holy beam of light. Your shield is no match for such power. As the light hits you, there is no pain. A tear streaks down your face as you realize Greg had mercy. He had mercy for the foolish child who dare challenge him. In your last moments you feel grateful to the man who gave you such an honorable ending.";
